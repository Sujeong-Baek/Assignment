In this course we will use the python programming language.

In my experience, students develop a style of programming in their
first programming language. They find it difficult to learn a
different style later, even if they switch to a different
language. This means that students should start early to use a modern
language that encourages writing clean and elegant code, and supports
a good object-oriented and functional style.

Most students will still have to learn C++ and/or Java later during
their studiesâ€”but I believe that after getting programming practice in
python, they will be able to write better code in those languages as
well.
